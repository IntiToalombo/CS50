Calculating the average of energy, danceability and valence might be a good aproach to calculate a person's audio aura
in my opinion is not enough. Since, There are many external factors that might cause an efect in the music listener for example
when a person is fall in love might be very happy but in the person's job things are not going well it, the mood of a person can change
fastly.
Also, we have to be aware that everyone tends to listen the same song or the same kind of genre since advices are everywhere, on internet,
TV, cines, etc. It encourage all of us to listen the same things so in clonclision we are a kind of Homogenous listners.
